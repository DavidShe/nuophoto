> A JavaScript/HTML5 canvas image editor

A nice editor built using imgEditor. At the moment they are the same project although as things move on I will probably separate them and create two independent projects. imgEditor will become a JS img library with editing functions and such, hopefully with less dependance on the canvas element.

Nuophoto will become a nice gui to interact with it and test it out.


Requirements:
-------

- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [requireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs)
- imgEditor
- workspace	(Just some gui functions bundled together)

Try it out:

Still in alpha stage of development. If you want to test the latest build check out:

*Note: The code contained in that location should be the latest build available in the Master branch*
