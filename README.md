nuophoto
========

> A JavaScript/HTML5 canvas image editor

Nuophoto is basically a web interface that aims to show the capabilities of JavaScript as a photo editing software.
The photo editing part is done with the library [PhotoJShop](https://github.com/aurbano/PhotoJShop).

Nuophoto and PhotoJShop started as the same project, but I realised that they should be developed independently, to provide image editing functions in JS without the need to load all the interface code in Nuophoto.
